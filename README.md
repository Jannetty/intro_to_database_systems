## Overview of directories
| Directory | Description |
| :-------: | :---------- |
| basic_sql_queries | Basic sql create table statements, imports, and queries using sqlite3 and local data files. Files can be downloaded and queries can be run. |
| advanced_sql | Advanced sql queries (along with basic sql create table statements and imports) using sqlite3 and data stored in [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) sql Server. Subset of database used is not known (and Server is no longer running) so queries cannot be used, but first 20 rows of output are commented on each .sql file. |
database_design | Mix of coding and written questions concerning database design. All .sql files use local data files that can be downloaded so queries can be run. |
| transactions | Written questions concerning transactions, schedulers, and conflict serializability. |
| vaccine_scheduler | Python code for appointment scheduler for vaccinations. Application ran on the command line terminal and connected to a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) database server. Server is no longer running and therefore code will no longer run. |

Each directory has a detailed README.md page with more details.
